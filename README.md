# PDF Reader
A script to generate low quality audios for texts, so I don't need to buy an audiobook subscription or something like that!

Pretty useful for if you go on a walk, you can listen to a PDF of your choosing! ðŸ˜Œ

Definitely not as good as the specialized apps for this, but I think this achieves the basic purpose without needing a lot of effort.

You might need to `pip install` necessary dependencies. Maybe I'll add a `.yml` file eventually to set up a conda environment. If you're having trouble setting it up and want to, email me at aathreyakadambi@gmail.com.
